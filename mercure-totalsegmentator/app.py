#TotalSegmentator App for mercure-totalsegmentator module

# TotalSegmentator (https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) is a software tool for segmentation of anatomical structures 
# in CT images and is distributed under the Apache 2.0 licence. The original creators of TotalSegmentator were not involved in 
# creation of the code in this app.

# This TotalSegmentator App folllows the MONAI Deploy SDK framework and contains code reused / adapted from the 
# TOTALSegmentator-AIDE app (https://github.com/GSTT-CSC/TotalSegmentator-AIDE)
# Modifications include :
# -Adaption of total_segmentator_operator.py to run --fast and --ml options of TotalSegmentator software
# -Modification of dcm2nii_operator.py to run in mercure module environment
# -Modification of rtstruct_writer_operator.py to loop through segmentations in single nii file
# -Additional operators for DICOM SEG and RGB DICOM output formats
